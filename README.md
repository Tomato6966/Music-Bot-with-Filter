*This Bot uses standard emojis, so just downloading it and filling in the TOKEN will make the Bot work!*

## Usage - config.json

```json
{
  "TOKEN": "",
  "PREFIX": "+",
}
```

It is important that you fill in every item of the JSON FILE! every emoji used in this BOT is a custom emoji, the emojis are listed down below as images, which you can download and upload to your server to use them. NOTE: you gotta change emoji.id to emoji.name if you use discord / unicode emojis! Soon a new Repo with standard emojis will be awailable for easy usages!
